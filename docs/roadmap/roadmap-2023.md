# Qdrant 2023 Roadmap

Hi!
This document is our plan for Qdrant development in 2023.
Previous year roadmap is available here:

* [Roadmap 2022](roadmap-2022.md)

Goals of the release:

* **Maintain easy upgrades** - we plan to keep backward compatibility for at least one minor version back.
  * That means that you can upgrade Qdrant without any downtime and without any changes in your client code within one minor version.
  * Storage should be compatible between any two consequent versions, so you can upgrade Qdrant with automatic data migration between consecutive versions.
* **Make billion-scale serving cheap** - qdrant already can serve billions of vectors, but we want to make it even more affordable.
* **Easy scaling** - our plan is to make it easy to dynamically scale Qdrant, so you could go from 1 to 1B vectors seamlessly.
* **Various similarity search scenarios** - we want to support more similarity search scenarios, e.g. sparse search, grouping requests, diverse search, etc.

## How to contribute

If you are a Qdrant user - Data Scientist, ML Engineer, or MLOps, the best contribution would be the feedback on your experience with Qdrant.
Let us know whenever you have a problem, face an unexpected behavior, or see a lack of documentation.
You can do it in any convenient way - create an [issue](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/issues), start a [discussion](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/discussions), or drop up a [message](https://discord.gg/tdtYvXjC4h).
If you use Qdrant or Metric Learning in your projects, we'd love to hear your story! Feel free to share articles and demos in our community.
